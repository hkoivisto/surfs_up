# Surfs_Up

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to analyze weather data on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. This data is to be presented to potential investors in a proposed ice cream and surf supply shop. The data is to serve as reassurance of the location's compatability with surfing and ice cream.

## Results

### Analysis

Data was reviewed from nine weather stations in Ohau to determine statistical data over a seven year range regarding precipitation and daily max temperature. June and December temperature data were reviewed to contrast the Summer and Winter weather in the proposed business location.

### Findings
     - Findings show that the largest difference between June and Decmeber temperatures is minimum temp. Even with similar mean temps, Decemeber still has a liklihood of cold days.
     - Max temperature is only 2 degrees higher for June than Decmber, confirming that Oahu experiences very mild winters.
     - The mean temperature for both June and December is in the low 70s, creating ideal conditions for surfing and ice cream.
